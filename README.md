# AMEX_data_hackathon
I participated in AMEX_data_hackathon organized by Vidya Analytics
Dataset is available in Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/huzefalw/amex-hackathon]. 
I have used Train.csv and Test.csv. 
My output is in form of Predictions.csv
I have used Random Forest. 
Further, hyperparameter tuning can result in better accuracy while testing.
